    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shakshuka is a hearty one-pan dish made with eggs poached in a spiced tomato and bell pepper sauce. Popular as a breakfast or brunch item, it’s packed with flavors from cumin, paprika, and fresh herbs. It’s easy to make and pairs wonderfully with crusty bread for dipping.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>4-5 medium tomatoes, chopped (or one 14-oz can of crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red chili flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4-6 eggs</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Optional: feta cheese crumbles</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Base:</strong>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the bell pepper and garlic, and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Tomato Sauce:</strong>Stir in the cumin, paprika, and chili flakes. Cook for 30 seconds to release the spices' aroma.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes (fresh or canned) and season with salt and pepper. Simmer the mixture for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Poach the Eggs:</strong>Use a spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack an egg into each well.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and let the eggs cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny (cook longer if you prefer firmer yolks).</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>Sprinkle with fresh parsley or cilantro, and crumble some feta cheese on top if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with crusty bread, pita, or even over rice.</li>
      </ol>
