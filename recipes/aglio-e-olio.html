    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta Aglio e Olio, meaning "garlic and oil" in Italian, is a simple yet flavorful dish originating from Naples. This recipe highlights the magic of just a few pantry staples: olive oil, garlic, chili flakes, and spaghetti. Itâ€™s light, comforting, and perfect for a quick lunch or dinner.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g of spaghetti or any pasta of choice</li>
        <li>4-5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili flakes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Freshly Ground pepper</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt to Taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and cook gently until golden and fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it will turn bitter.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chili flakes and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet and toss to coat in the garlic oil.</li>
        <li>If the pasta seems dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and parsley (if using). Toss well.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
